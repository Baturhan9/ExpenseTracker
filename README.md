# My second project - ExpenseTracker 
This is simple asp.net core mvc application, that used for tracker your spending. You can create group for spending, you can watch your all spending and etc. In this project I'm try to use repository pattern.From the features here, I have tried to use cookies and sessions to make the application run fast. I also added localization, but only of the start page, and only Russian and English ones
